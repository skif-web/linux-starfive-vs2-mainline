description: |
  This document defines device tree properties for the Innosilicon HDMI TX
  controller (INNO HDMI) IP core. It doesn't constitute a full device tree
  binding specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by device tree
  bindings for the platform-specific integrations of the INNO HDMI.

  When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
  this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  ports:
    $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/properties/ports

      port@1:
        $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/properties/port
        description:
          Port node with one endpoint connected to a hdmi-connector node.
